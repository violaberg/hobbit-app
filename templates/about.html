        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug came
        and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to
        add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that
        someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves
        also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a
        fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
                Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in exile,
                he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He
                fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and,
                using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him
                even in death.

Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.</p>

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother
                Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He
                fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot,
                along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

            <p>Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
            brother of Óin. In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and
            Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.</p>

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named
                Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have
                lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of
                Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he
                attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and Thorin
            Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.</p>

                Ori lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and Nori. In the
                year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other
                Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of
                Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

                of Thorin Oakenshield. Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both shared
                Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern
                Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

            familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of
            their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked
            as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life
            as a toy maker.</p>

                and Gandalf on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with his brother Bombur and cousin

            <p>Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although
            he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and
            TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was
            captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly
            150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin,
            after the loss of Thráin II.</p>

                dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin II Oakenshield and his
                company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and
